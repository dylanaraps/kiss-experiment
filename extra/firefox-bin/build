# a second instance of 'kiss' to install the tarball.

# This could have just unpacked the tarball and
# repacked it (as is done with shellcheck-bin and
# pandoc-bin) but due to its size, this workaround
# is needed.

# command yourself.
#
# I'm nice though and want this to fit into the system
# like any other package.

      temporary.
